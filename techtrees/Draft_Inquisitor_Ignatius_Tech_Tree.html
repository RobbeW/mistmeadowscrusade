        <h1>Commander Tech Tree - Lord Inquisitor Ignatius</h1>
        <h2>Commander Affiliation Rule - Zealous Authority</h2>
        <p><i> "Lord Inquisitor Ignatius prides himself on his unflinching resolve and determination to purge the heretic, the mutant and most of all the Daemon from the Empire. His brazen attitude, flaming conviction and unrelenting ferocity have drawn many acolytes and kindred spirits to his banner. Even some who themselves would arise doubt about their determination towards the Emperor of Mankind find a place aboard the Ignatius' flagship, the Ardor. As long as they search for redemption with overzealous use of hammer and bolter and yield their resources to his sole cause, to his highest authority, Ignatius averts his wrath and denounces all outside claims of heresy that might befall his most useful of henchmen.</p> 

    <p>This uneasy web of allegiances and destructive retaliation against any outsiders daring to doubt Ignatius' path, has proven useful in securing influential allies, single-minded warriors and instilling dread in the hearts of any foe. Human and un-human alike." </p></i>

        <h2>In-Game Effect</h2>
        <p>All units with this commander affiliation gain the following:</p>
        <b>Zealous Determination (aura)</b> - Enemy units that fail a Battle-shock Test within 12 inches of a Character unit with this battle trait suffer D3+1 Mortal Wounds. Enemy units within 12 inches of a unit with this battle trait cannot auto-pass or ignore Battle-shock tests, excluding using the Insane Bravery Stratagem. Enemy units within 12 inches cannot improve their Leadership characteristic in any way.
        <p><i>Designer's commentary: auras do not stack. Rules that ignore another army's battle ability are really uncool.</i></p>

                    <p><i>This mastery over the unseen is not merely a matter of stealth but of spiritual warfare. Ignatius teaches his followers that to dominate the battlefield, one must dominate fear itself, turning the enemy's dread back upon them. In this way, his forces remind the foes of Humanity that the darkness they once believed their ally is now their adversary. The shadows whisper of Imperial retribution, and with each shot fired from concealment, Ignatius' troops reinforce the lesson: fear the dark, for within it lurks not your kin, but the avenging angels of the Emperor.</i></p>

                <p><i>As the Ardor, flagship of Lord Inquisitor Ignatius, casts its shadow across the stars, its Enhanced Orbital Auspex Systems serve as the eyes of the Imperium, piercing through the veil of chaos that threatens to engulf the galaxy. At the outset of each campaign, these systems provide Ignatius and his forces with an unparalleled advantage, allowing them to mitigate the logistical nightmares that plague lesser commanders. Supply lines, so often the Achilles' heel of expeditionary forces, become unbreakable chains of steel. The encircling hordes of enemies, seeking to overwhelm through sheer numbers, find their tactics anticipated and countered before they can enclose the Imperium's forces. Even the capricious moods of alien worlds, with their hostile atmospheres and treacherous terrains, are rendered moot under the gaze of the Ardor's auspex.</i></p>

                <b>In-Game Effect:</b>
                <p>At the start of the game, you can ingnore penalties from Supply Lines, being surrounded and adverse weather effects.
                
                </br>
                During the battle, when determining the corruption level for your battle traits, treat the level of corruption as being 33% higher than it is.</p>
